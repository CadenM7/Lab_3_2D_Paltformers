# A Baker's Journey

The intent of our game is to be a Mario-like platformer, in which the player controls a rat and journeys across the countryside in order to return to his beloved bakery. 

The mechanics in this game are simple: 'A' and 'D' control the rat's movements, and Space Bar controls the jumps. 

Our game is purely an 8-Bit platformer.

The main stuggles in the creation of this game were dealing with merge conflicts and getting the scenes to cleanly change.

We wanted to avoid merge conflicts as much as possible, so Caden worked mainly in the main game scene, creating the basic mechanics and designing the entirety of the platforms, the paralax background, the dialog box, and more. Justin worked primarily with the scenes and GUI, alongside implementing the audio and many small aesthetic changes.
